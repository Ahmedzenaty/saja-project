            <p class="historypar">In 1998, The owner of the shop J.K. Symancyk had a kitten named Alfredo, and he had to travel a very long distance to buy supplies 
                and food for this kitten, but he wasn't the only one who had to do that. As more than half of all households in America have at least one pet.
                Therefore, in the year 2000, he took this problem as an idea to launch his project Planet Pet Store to sell pet supplies, 
                The first store opened in Chester, UK. but afer that, it expanded to become a chain of stores in many states, and in order to
                 reach all countries of the world, it was necessary to create an online store page</p>
